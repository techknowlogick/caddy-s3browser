# Caddy s3browser

This will provide directory listing for an S3 bucket (you are able to use minio, or other S3 providers).

Note: For performance reasons, the file listing is fetched once every 5 minutes to reduce load on S3. You can force a refresh by sending a POST request to the plugin.

## Building

Use [xcaddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy) to build.

Example:
````bash
$ go get -u github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy
$ xcaddy build --output ./caddy --with github.com/techknowlogick/caddy-s3browser
````

## Configuration

See `Caddyfile.tmpl` for a template.

## Force Refresh

You can trigger a force refresh by making a POST request to the server:
```bash
curl -X POST "$HOST"
```

When `refresh_api_secret` is set, you must use HTTP basic auth:
```bash
curl -X POST "api:$SECRET@$HOST" # the username can be anything
```
