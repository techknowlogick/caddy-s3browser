# Caddy s3browser

This will provide directory listing for an S3 bucket (you are able to use minio, or other S3 providers).

Note: For performance reasons, the file listing is fetched once every 5 minutes to reduce load on S3. You can force a refresh by sending a POST request to the plugin.

## Configuration

See `Caddyfile.tmpl` for a template.

|  option   |  type  |  default   | help |
|-----------|:------:|------------|------|
| site_name | string | S3 Browser | Site display name |
| endpoint  | string |            | S3 hostname |
| region    | string |   empty    | S3 region (optional) |
| key       | string |            | S3 access key |
| secret    | string |            | S3 secret key |
| secure    |  bool  |   `true`   | Use TLS when connection to S3 |
| bucket    | string |            | S3 bucket |
| refresh   | string |    `5m`    | Time between periodic refresh |
| debug     |  bool  |   `false`  | Output debug information |


## Downloading Files

To serve files via Caddy as well you'll need to use the `proxy` directive as well (see the template). The server must be able to have public access to the files in the bucket.
